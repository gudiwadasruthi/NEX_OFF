      "content": "Surgical robotics involves the integration of robotic technology in the operating room to aid surgeons in complex procedures. These systems offer improved precision, flexibility, and control compared to traditional surgery. Robotic arms controlled by surgeons translate hand movements into smaller, more precise actions. This technology often enables minimally invasive surgery with smaller incisions, leading to faster recovery and less pain. Surgical robots are used in urology, gynecology, cardiothoracic surgery, and more. The first robotic system approved by the FDA was the da Vinci Surgical System. Continuous advancements focus on enhanced imaging, haptic feedback, and autonomous capabilities. Surgical robotics combines engineering, computer science, and medical expertise to push the boundaries of surgical care."
