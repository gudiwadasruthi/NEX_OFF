      "heading": "Introduction",
      "content": "Data visualization transforms raw data into visual formats for human comprehension. Combines statistics, design, and storytelling. Historical roots in 18th-century charts (William Playfair). Modern tools include Tableau, D3.js, and Power BI. Used across science, business, and journalism. Effective visuals follow Gestalt principles of perception. Interactive dashboards enable real-time exploration. Challenges include misleading representations and cognitive overload."

      "heading": "Key Features",
      "content": "Visual encodings map data to shapes/colors. Hierarchical displays show part-whole relationships. Temporal visuals reveal trends over time. Geospatial maps display location-based patterns. Multivariate techniques compare >3 dimensions. Animation shows data evolution. Interactivity allows user-driven exploration. Accessibility features aid colorblind users. Tools range from Excel to custom Python libraries (Matplotlib)."
