      "heading": "Introduction",
      "content": "Genomics explores the structure, function, and evolution of genomes, the complete set of DNA within an organism. Personalized medicine uses genetic information to customize healthcare, moving away from one-size-fits-all treatments. Advances in sequencing technologies have made genome analysis faster and cheaper, enabling widespread use. Understanding genetic variations helps predict disease risk, drug response, and treatment outcomes. This approach improves diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy. Ethical and privacy concerns about genetic data management are critical. Integration of genomics with other ‘omics’ fields expands insights into complex diseases."
