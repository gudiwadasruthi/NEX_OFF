      "content": "Web development is the process of building websites and web applications that are accessible via the internet or an intranet. It involves frontend development (UI/UX), backend development (server logic), and full-stack approaches combining both. Frontend developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive user experiences. Backend developers build the infrastructure, working with databases, APIs, and server logic in languages like Python, Node.js, Ruby, and PHP. Modern web apps rely on frameworks like React, Angular, and Django for scalability and maintainability. Responsive design ensures compatibility across devices. Security, performance, and accessibility are critical concerns. Web development continues to evolve with tools like Jamstack, headless CMS, and serverless architectures."

    {
      "heading": "Key Features",
      "content": "Web development includes static and dynamic content delivery. Frontend involves responsive layouts, animations, and user input handling. Backend covers data processing, authentication, and file storage. APIs enable communication between client and server. DevOps practices like CI/CD streamline deployment. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) offer offline capabilities. SEO and performance optimization improve visibility and speed. Accessibility standards ensure inclusive design. Testing and debugging tools aid in quality assurance. Web development follows the MVC or MVVM architectural patterns for organization."
