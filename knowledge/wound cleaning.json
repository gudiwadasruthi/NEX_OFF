Keep pressing until the bleeding stops (a few minutes).\n\n3) Clean the Wound: Rinse the wound gently with clean water. Use mild soap around the wound (not inside). Remove dirt with tweezers if needed (clean them first with alcohol).\n\n4) Apply Antiseptic: Use an antiseptic wipe or cream (like Betadine or Dettol) to kill germs.\n\n5) Cover the Wound: Use a band-aid for small cuts. Use gauze and tape for larger wounds. Don’t wrap too tightly.\n\n6) Keep It Clean: Change the bandage daily or if it gets wet or dirty. Watch for signs of infection (redness, swelling, pus, pain).\n\n7) Get Help if Needed: If the wound is deep, keeps bleeding, or looks infected — see a doctor."
