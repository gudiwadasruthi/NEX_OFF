      "content": "An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions used to solve a computational problem. It provides a step-by-step procedure that converts input into a desired output. Algorithms are essential in computer science, enabling efficient problem-solving and data processing. They can range from simple operations, like sorting a list, to complex tasks, such as image recognition. Understanding algorithms is crucial for developing effective software and systems."

      "heading": "Key Features",
      "content": "Algorithms have several key characteristics: they are well-defined, finite, and produce a specific output for a given input. Efficiency is measured in terms of time and space complexity, often using Big O notation. Algorithms can be deterministic or non-deterministic and may involve iterative or recursive processes. They are designed to be language-independent, focusing on the logic rather than syntax."

      "heading": "Subfields",
      "content": "Algorithms encompass various subfields, including sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort), search algorithms (e.g., binary search), graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm), and dynamic programming. Each subfield addresses specific types of problems and employs unique strategies for optimization and efficiency."
