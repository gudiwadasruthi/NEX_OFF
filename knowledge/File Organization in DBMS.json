      "content": "1) Sequential File Organization: Records are stored one after another in a fixed order, usually sorted by key. To access a record, search starts from the beginning. Best for batch processing like payroll.\n\nPros: Simple, easy to implement, efficient for reading all data.\nCons: Slow for searching individual records, inefficient insert/delete.\n\n2) Heap (Unordered) File Organization: Records stored in no particular order, new records appended at the end.\n\nPros: Fast inserts, simple structure.\nCons: Slow search and updates, no sorting or indexing.\n\n3) Hashed File Organization: Uses a hash function to compute the exact location of records for direct access by key.\n\nPros: Very fast access for exact key searches.\nCons: Collisions can occur, poor for range queries.\n\n4) Indexed File Organization: Uses an index (like a bookâ€™s index) to locate records quickly. Data may be stored sequentially or unordered.\n\nPros: Fast search and access, supports range queries.\nCons: Index requires storage, updates slow because index must be updated.\n\n5) Clustered File Organization: Stores related records physically together (eg, all orders for a customer).\n\nPros: Better performance for accessing grouped data.\nCons: Complex to maintain, less flexible."
