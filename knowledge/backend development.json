      "heading": "Key Features",
      "content": "Server-side Programming: Writing code that runs on the server using languages such as Python, Node-js (JavaScript), Java, PHP, Ruby, or C#.\n\nDatabase Management: Storing, retrieving, and managing data using relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Redis).\n\nAPI Development: Creating endpoints for client-server communication, often using REST or GraphQL APIs.\n\nAuthentication & Authorization: Implementing secure user login systems, roles, and permissions.\n\nBusiness Logic: Enforcing application-specific rules, data validation, and workflows.\n\nMiddleware: Software that connects different parts of the system, such as handling requests and responses.\n\nSecurity: Protecting backend from attacks (SQL injection, CSRF, XSS), managing encryption, and secure data transmission.\n\nScalability: Designing backend to handle growing user loads and data efficiently."

      "heading": "Types / Components",
      "content": "Server: The environment where backend code runs (physical or cloud servers).\n\nDatabase: Stores application data, can be relational or NoSQL.\n\nApplication Logic: Code that performs calculations, processes data, and controls workflow.\n\nAPIs: Interfaces that allow frontend or other services to interact with the backend.\n\nAuthentication & Authorization Systems: Managing user identity and access control.\n\nMiddleware: Functions that intercept and process requests/responses (logging, session management)."

      "heading": "Advantages",
      "content": "Enables dynamic and interactive web applications by managing data and business logic.\n\nSeparates concerns, allowing frontend and backend to evolve independently.\n\nProvides secure and controlled access to data and resources.\n\nSupports complex operations that cannot be performed on the client-side.\n\nFacilitates integration with other services and third-party APIs."

      "heading": "Limitations / Challenges",
      "content": "Requires strong understanding of server-side technologies and security practices.\n\nCan become complex as applications grow in size and features.\n\nPerformance bottlenecks can arise if backend is not optimized or scalable.\n\nDebugging server-side issues can be harder than client-side.\n\nEnsuring security against evolving cyber threats is ongoing.\n\nManaging state and sessions in a stateless HTTP environment can be challenging."
