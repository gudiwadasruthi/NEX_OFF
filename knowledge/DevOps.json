      "heading": "Introduction",
      "content": "DevOps emerged in 2009 to bridge gaps between development and operations teams. It emphasizes automation, continuous delivery, and rapid iteration. Core principles include infrastructure as code (IaC) and monitoring. Adopted by tech giants like Amazon and Netflix. Combines agile methodologies with operational stability. CI/CD pipelines automate testing and deployment. Cloud-native technologies (containers, Kubernetes) are foundational. Challenges include organizational resistance and toolchain complexity."

    {
      "heading": "Key Features",
      "content": "Continuous Integration merges code changes frequently. Continuous Delivery automates deployment to staging. Continuous Deployment pushes to production automatically. Infrastructure as Code manages resources via config files (Terraform). Microservices architecture enables modular development. Monitoring/Logging tracks system health (Prometheus, ELK). Version control (Git) is mandatory. Security integration (DevSecOps) is increasingly critical. Requires cultural shift beyond just tools."
