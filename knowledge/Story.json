      "content": "Interactive storytelling allows users to engage with narratives by making choices that affect the plot, characters, or outcomes. It blends traditional storytelling with digital interactivity. Common formats include video games, interactive films, AR/VR experiences, and web narratives. Techniques include branching storylines, multiple endings, and dynamic character development. The userâ€™s actions shape the narrative path, creating a personalized experience. Tools like Twine, Unity, and Unreal are often used to develop such experiences. Writers and developers work together to design immersive, responsive narratives. Feedback loops, pacing, and emotional arcs must adapt to user decisions. The field fosters innovation in entertainment, education, and training. It challenges linear storytelling conventions and empowers the audience."
