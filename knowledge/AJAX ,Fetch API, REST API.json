      "heading": "Definition",
      "content": "AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): AJAX is a technique used in web development to create asynchronous web applications. It allows web pages to send and receive data from a server in the background without reloading the entire page, enhancing user experience with dynamic content updates.\n\nFetch API: Fetch API is a modern JavaScript interface for making network requests. It provides a more powerful and flexible feature set than the older XMLHttpRequest used in AJAX, enabling easier syntax and better handling of promises for asynchronous operations.\n\nREST APIs (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces): REST APIs are a set of conventions for building and interacting with web services. RESTful services use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs, enabling communication between clients and servers.\n"

    {
      "heading": "Key Features",
      "content": "AJAX:\n- Enables asynchronous communication between client and server.\n- Can send and receive data in various formats (XML, JSON, HTML, plain text).\n- Allows partial page updates without full reload.\n- Uses XMLHttpRequest object for requests.\n- Widely supported in all modern browsers.\n\nFetch API:\n- Uses Promises for asynchronous operations, simplifying code structure.\n- Supports a more flexible and cleaner syntax than XMLHttpRequest.\n- Handles JSON natively with .json() method.\n- Supports request customization including headers, credentials, cache, and modes (CORS, no-cors).\n- Provides better error handling and streaming responses.\n\nREST APIs:\n- Stateless communication between client and server.\n- Use standard HTTP methods (GET for read, POST for create, PUT/PATCH for update, DELETE for delete).\n- Resources are identified via URIs/URLs.\n- Responses are typically in JSON or XML format.\n- Supports scalability, caching, and layered system architecture.\n"

      "heading": "Types / Subfields",
      "content": "AJAX:\n- XMLHttpRequest-based AJAX: traditional approach.\n- AJAX with JSON: exchanging data in JSON format.\n- AJAX polling and long polling: techniques for real-time updates.\n\nFetch API:\n- Basic fetch requests (GET, POST).\n- Handling headers and request options.\n- Using fetch with async/await syntax.\n- Error and response status handling.\n- Streaming and aborting fetch requests.\n\nREST APIs:\n- Public APIs: accessible to external developers.\n- Private APIs: used internally within organizations.\n- RESTful web services vs SOAP APIs (REST is lightweight and uses HTTP directly).\n- CRUD operations mapped to HTTP methods.\n- Authentication and authorization via tokens (OAuth, JWT).\n"

      "heading": "Advantages",
      "content": "AJAX:\n- Improves user experience by avoiding full page reloads.\n- Allows dynamic and responsive web applications.\n- Works in all major browsers.\n- Enables partial content loading and form validation.\n\nFetch API:\n- Cleaner, more readable asynchronous code with promises.\n- Native JSON support makes data handling easier.\n- Better control over request and response handling.\n- Simplifies complex HTTP requests and streaming data.\n\nREST APIs:\n- Lightweight and easy to use over HTTP.\n- Language and platform independent.\n- Easy to scale and cache responses.\n- Well-suited for distributed systems and microservices.\n- Widely adopted standard in web and mobile app development.\n"

    {
      "heading": "Limitations / Challenges",
      "content": "AJAX:\n- Older XMLHttpRequest syntax can be verbose and complex.\n- Browser compatibility quirks in very old browsers.\n- Handling complex asynchronous flows may lead to callback hell (mitigated by promises and async/await).\n- Security concerns like Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).\n\nFetch API:\n- Does not support progress events (for upload/download progress) natively.\n- Requires polyfills for compatibility with older browsers.\n- CORS restrictions can prevent cross-origin requests without server configuration.\n\nREST APIs:\n- Statelessness requires all necessary info be sent with each request, which can increase overhead.\n- Versioning APIs can be complex.\n- Security concerns require robust authentication and encryption.\n- Not ideal for real-time communication compared to WebSockets.\n- Rate limiting and throttling need to be managed for scalability.\n"
