      "content": "Human-Computer Interaction focuses on improving the usability and user experience of computer systems. It combines knowledge from computer science, design, psychology, and ergonomics. HCI research studies how people interact with software, hardware, and emerging technologies like VR and voice assistants. The goal is to create intuitive, efficient, and satisfying interfaces. It involves user-centered design, prototyping, and usability testing. HCI also addresses accessibility to ensure technology works for diverse populations. Advances in AI and natural language processing have expanded interaction modalities. HCI helps reduce errors, improve productivity, and increase adoption of technology. It is critical for developing consumer electronics, enterprise software, and digital services. Ethical considerations in privacy and user well-being are also central."
