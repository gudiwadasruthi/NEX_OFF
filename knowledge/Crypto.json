      "content": "Cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography and typically operating on blockchain networks. Bitcoin, launched in 2009, was the first widely adopted cryptocurrency. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) extends blockchain technology to create open, permissionless financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional intermediaries. These innovations challenge conventional banking by providing greater accessibility, transparency, and control to users. DeFi platforms use smart contracts to automate transactions securely. The ecosystem includes decentralized exchanges (DEXs), stablecoins, and yield farming protocols. Cryptocurrencies are volatile and face regulatory scrutiny globally. Blockchain underpins security and immutability of transactions. Adoption is growing for payments, investments, and cross-border transfers. The space is rapidly evolving with new applications and challenges."
