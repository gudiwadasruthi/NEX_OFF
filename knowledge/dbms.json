      "content": "Data Storage & Retrieval – Efficiently stores large amounts of data and retrieves it on request.\n\nData Integrity – Ensures data is accurate and consistent.\n\nSecurity – Allows user access control and data protection.\n\nBackup & Recovery – Restores data in case of failure or crash.\n\nConcurrency Control – Multiple users can access data at the same time safely.\n\nData Independence – Application programs remain unaffected by changes in data structure.\n\nQuery Processing – Supports languages like SQL to interact with the database."

      "content": "Relational DBMS (RDBMS): Stores data in tables. Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.\n\nHierarchical DBMS: Data is organized in a tree-like structure. Example: IBM's IMS.\n\nNetwork DBMS: Uses a graph-like structure with many-to-many relationships. Example: Integrated Data Store (IDS).\n\nObject-oriented DBMS (OODBMS): Stores data as objects (like in OOP). Example: db4o, ObjectDB.\n\nNoSQL DBMS: Designed for unstructured or semi-structured data. Example: MongoDB, Cassandra.\n\nCloud-based DBMS: Managed and accessed via the cloud. Example: Amazon RDS, Firebase."
