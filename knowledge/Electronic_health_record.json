      "content": "Electronic Health Records (EHR) are digital repositories of patients’ health information, replacing traditional paper charts. They facilitate seamless sharing of medical data across different healthcare providers and institutions. EHRs improve care coordination, reduce errors, and enhance patient safety. The transition to EHRs has been driven by advancements in health IT and regulatory incentives. They include comprehensive data such as medical history, diagnoses, medications, immunizations, and lab results. EHR systems are designed to support clinical decision-making and improve healthcare outcomes. Data privacy and security are critical concerns. Interoperability standards allow different EHR systems to communicate effectively."
