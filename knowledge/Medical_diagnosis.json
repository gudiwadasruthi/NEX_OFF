      "heading": "Introduction",
      "content": "Medical diagnostics is a critical part of healthcare, involving the identification of diseases through tests and imaging. AI has significantly enhanced this domain by enabling machines to detect patterns in data with precision, often rivaling or exceeding human experts. In radiology, AI can analyze X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans to detect tumors, fractures, or abnormalities. In pathology, AI systems review biopsy samples and tissue slides to identify disease markers and classify cancer stages. These advancements improve early detection, reduce diagnostic errors, and speed up clinical workflows. As AI models learn from vast datasets, their performance continues to improve. Regulatory bodies are increasingly approving AI tools for clinical use. These technologies support, not replace, medical professionals, acting as second opinions and assisting in high-volume settings."
