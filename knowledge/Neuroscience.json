      "heading": "Introduction",
      "content": "Neuroscience explores the structure and function of the nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are technologies that establish a direct communication pathway between the brain and external devices, bypassing traditional neuromuscular pathways. BCIs decode neural signals to control computers, prosthetics, or other assistive devices, opening new possibilities for individuals with disabilities. Recent advances in neuroimaging, signal processing, and machine learning have propelled BCI research forward. The field bridges neuroscience, engineering, computer science, and medicine. Understanding brain activity at various scales is critical to developing effective BCIs. These technologies hold promise for restoring lost functions and enhancing human capabilities. Ethical considerations around privacy and consent are central to BCI development."

      "heading": "Key Features",
      "content": "BCIs can be invasive (implanted electrodes) or non-invasive (EEG, MEG). Signal acquisition captures brain activity patterns associated with intentions or commands. Signal processing filters and extracts meaningful neural features. Machine learning algorithms translate brain signals into device commands. Feedback systems enable users to learn and improve control. Neuroplasticity aids adaptation to BCI use. Real-time processing allows immediate interaction. Wireless and portable systems enhance usability. Multimodal BCIs combine brain signals with other biosignals. Safety, reliability, and low latency are crucial design goals."
