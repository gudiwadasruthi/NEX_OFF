      "content": "Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems, while data structures are ways to organize and store data efficiently. Together, they form the core of computer science and software engineering. Mastery of both is essential for designing scalable, high-performance systems. Algorithms range from simple sorting techniques to complex graph traversals and optimization routines. Data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and hash maps provide frameworks for handling various types of data. Efficient use of these tools leads to faster, more responsive applications. They are language-agnostic and apply across domains. Understanding time and space complexity helps evaluate algorithm efficiency. They underpin everything from databases to operating systems. Competitive programming and technical interviews heavily emphasize these topics."

      "heading": "Key Features",
      "content": "Algorithm design focuses on correctness, efficiency, and clarity. Time complexity (Big-O notation) estimates execution time growth. Space complexity considers memory usage. Common algorithm paradigms include divide-and-conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming. Recursion enables elegant solutions for hierarchical problems. Data structures determine how efficiently data can be accessed or modified. Hashing offers constant-time lookups; trees provide ordered traversal. Stacks and queues manage order-sensitive tasks. Graphs model networks and relationships. Performance tuning often involves selecting optimal algorithms and data structures."

      "heading": "Challenges",
      "content": "Designing optimal algorithms for specific problems is non-trivial. Debugging recursive logic can be complex. Space-time trade-offs need careful consideration. Real-world data may not fit theoretical models. Incorrect implementations lead to performance bottlenecks. Visualizing advanced structures is difficult for beginners. Algorithms may require domain-specific customization. Scalability becomes an issue with large datasets. Lack of abstraction in low-level data structures. Balancing readability and efficiency in implementation."
