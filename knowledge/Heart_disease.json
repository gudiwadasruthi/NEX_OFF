      "heading": "Definition",
      "content": "Heart disease is a broad term for conditions affecting the heart's structure and function. It includes coronary artery disease (narrowed arteries), arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), heart failure (weakened pumping), and congenital heart defects. It is the leading cause of death globally. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes. Some types are inherited, while others develop due to lifestyle or medical conditions. Symptoms vary depending on the specific disease but may include chest pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling in the legs. Early diagnosis and intervention can improve outcomes significantly. Lifestyle changes, medication, and sometimes surgery are used for treatment. Ongoing management is critical for quality of life."

      "heading": "Causes",
      "content": "Common causes include atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries), hypertension, and poor lifestyle habits like smoking and inactivity. High cholesterol and diabetes significantly increase risk. Genetic factors can predispose individuals to structural or rhythm disorders. Viral infections may also damage heart tissue. Some medications and drugs, such as chemotherapy or cocaine, can contribute to heart disease. Uncontrolled stress is a contributing factor. Many causes are interrelated, such as obesity causing both diabetes and hypertension. Preventative care focuses on managing these risk factors. Early lifestyle interventions are key."

      "heading": "Symptoms",
      "content": "Symptoms vary widely depending on the type of heart disease. Chest pain or discomfort is common in coronary artery disease. Heart failure may cause fatigue, breathlessness, and swelling in the ankles or abdomen. Arrhythmias may lead to palpitations, dizziness, or even fainting. Some heart conditions may be silent until they reach a critical stage. Women often experience subtler symptoms like jaw pain or nausea. Regular screening is vital, especially for high-risk individuals. Sudden symptoms like chest tightness or loss of consciousness should prompt emergency care. Monitoring changes in energy or endurance can indicate heart issues."

      "heading": "Diagnosis",
      "content": "Diagnosis involves physical exams, medical history, and various tests. Electrocardiograms (ECG), echocardiograms, stress tests, and coronary angiograms are common. Blood tests can identify markers like cholesterol or cardiac enzymes. Holter monitors may be used for long-term rhythm tracking. In some cases, MRI or CT scans provide detailed images of the heart. Genetic testing is used for inherited conditions. Early detection allows better management and may prevent severe complications. Routine check-ups are especially important for those with family history or risk factors. Multiple tests are often used together for accurate diagnosis."

      "heading": "Medications",
      "content": "**Statins** such as **Atorvastatin** or **Rosuvastatin** lower cholesterol levels and stabilize arterial plaque. **Beta-blockers** like **Metoprolol** reduce blood pressure and heart rate, easing the heart's workload. **ACE inhibitors** such as **Lisinopril** or **Ramipril** lower blood pressure and prevent heart failure. **Calcium channel blockers** like **Amlodipine** help relax blood vessels. **Diuretics** (e.g., **Furosemide**) reduce fluid buildup in heart failure. **Nitrates** like **Nitroglycerin** relieve chest pain by widening arteries. **Antiplatelet drugs** such as **Aspirin** and **Clopidogrel** prevent clot formation. Patients with arrhythmias may be prescribed **Amiodarone** or **Digoxin**. Medication must be tailored based on type and severity of heart disease. Regular follow-up ensures effectiveness and safety."
