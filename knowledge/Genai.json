      "heading": "Introduction",
      "content": "Generative AI leverages machine learning models, such as GANs and transformers, to create original art and music. It mimics human creativity by learning patterns from large datasets and generating novel outputs. In art, AI can produce paintings, digital art, and animations. In music, it composes melodies, harmonies, and entire tracks. Artists use generative AI as a tool for inspiration and collaboration. The technology raises questions about authorship and creativity. It democratizes access to artistic creation by lowering technical barriers. Generative AI is increasingly used in advertising, entertainment, and design. Challenges include ensuring originality and ethical considerations. Ongoing research explores improving AI's contextual and emotional understanding."
