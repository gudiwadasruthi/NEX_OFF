      "heading": "Key Features",
      "content": "Easy to learn and use due to simple, English-like syntax.\nInterpreted language enabling immediate code execution and easy debugging.\nDynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.\nExtensive standard library covering diverse tasks such as file handling, web development, and more.\nCross-platform compatibility allowing it to run on various operating systems.\nObject-oriented programming support for modular and reusable code.\nOpen-source with a large community and many third-party libraries."

    {
      "heading": "Limitations",
      "content": "Execution speed is slower compared to compiled languages like C or C++.\nGlobal Interpreter Lock (GIL) restricts true parallel execution in multi-threaded CPU-bound programs.\nLess suitable for mobile application development.\nDynamic typing can result in runtime errors that are not caught during compilation."
