      "content": "1) *Check for Response: Gently tap the person's shoulder and loudly ask, \"Are you okay?\" If they do not respond and are not breathing or only gasping, CPR should be started immediately to support their breathing and circulation.\n\n2) **Call for Help: Call emergency services immediately (112 or your local number). If possible, ask someone nearby to make the call so you can focus on providing CPR. Put the phone on speaker mode to communicate with dispatchers while performing CPR.\n\n3) **Chest Compressions: Place the heel of one hand in the center of the person's chest. Put your other hand on top and interlock your fingers. Keep your arms straight and shoulders directly above your hands. Push hard and fast at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute, compressing the chest about 5 to 6 centimeters (2 inches) deep. Allow the chest to fully recoil between compressions. A helpful tip is to push in rhythm with the song “Stayin’ Alive.”\n\n4) **Give Rescue Breaths (if trained): After 30 compressions, provide 2 rescue breaths by tilting the person's head back and lifting the chin to open the airway. Pinch their nose shut, breathe into their mouth, and watch for the chest to rise. If you are not trained or uncomfortable giving breaths, continue with chest compressions only (hands-only CPR).\n\n5) **Keep Going*: Continue performing CPR without interruption until:\n- The person shows signs of life such as waking or breathing\n- Emergency medical personnel arrive and take over\n- You are too exhausted to continue safely"
