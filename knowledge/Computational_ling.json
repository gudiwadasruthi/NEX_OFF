      "content": "Computational linguistics combines linguistics and computer science to analyze and generate human language. It involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enable machines to understand text and speech. The field covers syntax, semantics, morphology, and pragmatics in computational models. Applications include machine translation, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis. Researchers develop algorithms to parse, tag, and interpret language data. It supports voice assistants, chatbots, and automated customer service. The discipline helps bridge communication gaps between humans and machines. Computational linguistics also addresses challenges in ambiguity, context, and cultural nuances. It involves both rule-based and statistical methods, including machine learning. The field continually evolves with advances in AI and big data."
