      "heading": "Introduction",
      "content": "Quantum computing uses quantum bits or qubits, which can represent 0, 1, or both simultaneously through superposition. It exploits quantum phenomena like entanglement and interference to perform computations at unprecedented speeds. Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, optimization, and drug discovery. Development faces challenges in error correction, qubit coherence, and scalability. Various hardware approaches exist, including superconducting circuits and trapped ions. Quantum algorithms like Shor’s and Grover’s offer advantages over classical methods. Research is ongoing in both theoretical and practical aspects. Quantum computing could solve problems currently infeasible for classical computers. Its impact spans science, industry, and security. Commercial and governmental interest is rapidly growing."
