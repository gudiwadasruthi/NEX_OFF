      "content": "Data Science blends computer science, statistics, and domain knowledge to derive actionable insights from data. It encompasses data cleaning, exploration, modeling, and communication of results. The field has grown with the explosion of big data and advancements in storage and processing. It plays a critical role in business intelligence, predictive analytics, and operational optimization. Data scientists use tools like Python, R, SQL, and visualization libraries. The workflow often includes hypothesis testing, model building, and result interpretation. Increasingly, data science integrates with machine learning for predictive modeling. Ethical considerations such as data privacy and fairness are gaining importance. Data storytelling through visualizations and dashboards helps convey insights effectively. Data Science is a core capability for modern data-driven organizations."
