      "content": "3D printing, or additive manufacturing, builds objects layer by layer from digital designs. It contrasts with subtractive methods like machining. This technology enables rapid prototyping, customization, and complex geometries unachievable by traditional means. Materials used include plastics, metals, ceramics, and composites. Industries such as aerospace, healthcare, automotive, and consumer products widely adopt it. 3D printing reduces waste and shortens production cycles. It also supports decentralized manufacturing and on-demand production. Advances in multi-material and bioprinting expand possibilities. Challenges include speed, size limitations, and material properties. Overall, additive manufacturing is reshaping manufacturing paradigms globally."
