      "heading": "Precautions & Home Care",
      "content": "Rest: Allow the affected muscle to rest to avoid further strain.\n\nIce: Apply a cold pack to reduce swelling and inflammation (for the first 48 hours after injury).\n\nHeat: After 48 hours, apply a warm compress to relax tight muscles.\n\nStretching: Gentle stretching or yoga can help relieve muscle tension.\n\nMassage: Lightly massaging the painful area can help increase blood flow and reduce tightness.\n\nHydration: Drink plenty of water to keep muscles hydrated and prevent cramping.\n\nOver-the-counter pain relief: Use medications like ibuprofen or paracetamol to relieve pain and inflammation (follow dosage instructions)."
